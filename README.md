#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.

Software Engineering is the systematic approach of developing and maintaining Software using engineering principles. It is important to the technology industry because it helps develop high-quality software and helps manage the cost of producing that software while maintaining high quality. 


Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
1. The invention of Digital computers in the 1950s
2. The creation of software engineering as a discipline in the 1960s
3. The creation of structured programming language 1970s


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
1. Requirement Phase: This is where the user needs for the software are collected and documented.
2. Design Phase: This is where the architecture and structure of the software are designed as per the requirement documented.
3. Implementation: This involves the coding of the software.
4. Testing: this involves the software to make sure it meets the requirements.
5. Deployment: This involves releasing the software to users.
6. Maintenance: This involves continuous updates and fixes post-production. 


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.

Waterfall methodology is a sequential, rigid software development process that does not allow for changes until one phase is completed. It is usually suitable for projects with well-defined requirements that do not require constant changes, such as government projects and medical device software. In contrast, Agile methodology involves an incremental process of constant development with a lot of room for changes at any time. It is highly flexible and suitable for projects that are more focused on delivery than documentation, such as mobile apps, AI, and machine learning projects.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.

A software developer is responsible for writing codes and implementing the software requirements.
A Quality Assurance Engineer is responsible for making sure the software is developed to the utmost quality, that the software meets the user requirements, and that its processes are of a high standard. 
A project manager is responsible for managing the development process, making sure every phase is done appropriately, and facilitating proper communication between the development teams. 


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.

IDEs help facilitate the development process by providing a coding environment, debugging, compiling, and error detection tools.For example VScode
VCS helps manage different versions of the software, tracking changes in codes over time and facilitating collaboration among developers. For example Git.

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.

Some of the challenges include constant change in requirements, tight deadlines, and technical debt. all these can be remedied by using Agile methodology, prioritizing tasks, effective communication, and using a  version control system to track changes.


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.

Unit testing involves testing individual components, Integration testing tests the interaction between component modules, System testing tests the entire system, and Acceptance testing checks whether it meets user requirements.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.

Prompt engineering involves crafting clear and concise instructions for AI to achieve the desired results. It is important because it helps reduce vague and irrelevant answers.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.

An example of a vague prompt is asking the AI to tell you about animals instead of asking it to tell you about the animal cat which is more specific and it filters out all unnecessary results about other animals.
